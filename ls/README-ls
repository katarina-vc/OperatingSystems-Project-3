#README ls Implementation - Operating Systems - Project 1
This ls folder contains screenshots showing outputs for each of the grading criteria for the ls portion of the project.

For this file, we implemented an ls command that displays files in a specific directory. For repostories it adds "/" at the end. With a "-a" flag it also displays hidden files.
The file was tested with Canvas examples and expected results. Examples can be found in this folder as .png files.
